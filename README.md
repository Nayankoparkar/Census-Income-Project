In this census income project i have to examine whether an indiviual makes 50,000 anually or not.
for predicting that initially i haave preprocess the data,to get understanding of the dataset.
In the preprocessing i performed the EDA (exploratory data analysis).
After that becuase i have to classify whether  an indiviual makes 50000 or not
I have applied machine learning algorihm which is "logistics Regression" which is used for binary classification.
