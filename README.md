# Project Title: Predicting Census Income using Machine Learning Techniques

## Project Description:
In this project, I applied machine learning techniques to predict the annual income of individuals based on census data. The objective of the project was to identify patterns and relationships in the data and build a model to accurately predict income.
# Methods:
Collected and preprocessed the census data using Python libraries such as Pandas and Numpy
Explored and visualized the data to identify patterns and relationships
Built and evaluated a machine learning model,which is logistic regression

# Key findings:
Important features that had a significant impact on income prediction included education level, occupation, and age

# Conclusion:
The results of this project demonstrated my ability to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem and extract meaningful insights from data. The model developed in this project could be used to predict the income of individuals and support decision-making in various industries. This project showcases my technical skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning.
